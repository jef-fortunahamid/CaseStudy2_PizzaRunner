## Business Task
Danny, inspired by an 80's Retro Styling ans Pizza trend on Instagram, decided to start a pizza delivery business, He name dit "Pizza Runner" and combined the pizza trend with an Uber-like delivery method. He hired "runners" for delivery and developed a mobile app for order placements.
With his background in data science, Danny knows the importance of data. He's created a database design for Pizza Runner but needs help cleaning the data and making calculations. This will help him manage his runners more efficiently and optimise the business operations.

## Genaral Insights
- *Customer and Runner Experience:* The queries delved into understanding the efficiency and experience of runners. This included insights into the number of runners signing up each week, the average time taken for order pickups, and the relationship between the number of pizzas ordered and preparation time.
- *Ingredient Optimization:* Several questions aimed to understand the standard ingredients for each pizza, the most commonly added extras, and the most common exclusions. This provides insights into customer preferences and potential areas for menu optimization.
- *Pricing and Ratings:* This section focused on understanding the revenue generated by Pizza Runner. It considered fixed pizza prices, additional charges for extras, and delivery fees. Additionally, a new ratings system was proposed to capture customer feedback on their delivery experience.
- *Menu Expansion:* The bonus question explored the implications of adding a new pizza type to the menu, demonstrating how the current data design can accommodate such changes.

## Key SQL Syntax and Functions
- Temporary Tables (CREATE TEMP TABLE)
- Joins (LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT SEMI JOIN)
- Aggregation Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Window Functions(RANK)
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)
- Date Functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATE_PART, AGE)
- String Functions (STRING_AGG, REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE)

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
### Table: customer_orders
If we are going to look closely at the table, there are some inconsistencies.
- There are missing/blanks and null values in both `exclusions` and `extras` columns
![image](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/CaseStudy2_PizzaRunner/assets/125134025/95ce827d-cf61-4041-b1fc-f2ac11e0e030)
We must clean up the `customer_orders` table. This cleaned-up table will be easier to work with for subsequent analyses and operations. We will proceed with the following:
- We need to create a temporary table with cleaned `exlcusions` and `extras` columns.
- We will replace the missing/blanks and 'null' values with NULL value.
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS 
SELECT
    order_id
  , customer_id
  , pizza_id
  , CASE 
      WHEN exclusions IN ('', 'null') THEN NULL
      ELSE exclusions
      END AS exclusions
  , CASE 
      WHEN extras IN ('', 'null') THEN NULL
      ELSE extras
      END AS extras
  , order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

SELECT *
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
In this query, the `CASE WHEN` statement checks if the `exclusions` and `extras` values are blank ('') and 'null', and if so, replaces them with the `NULL` value.

### Table: runner_orders
Again, if we are going to look closely at this table, there are some issues.
- In the `pickup_time` column, we don't know if the null values correspond to the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `distance` column, there are a few issues here. We have values where the number is directly followed by 'km' without a space. We also have instances where there's a space between the number and 'km'. Additionally, it's unclear if the null values are the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `duration` column, quite a few issues here as well. We've got mins, minute and minutes, both with and without spaces. Additionally, it's uncertain whether the null values correspond to the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `cancellation` column, we've got missing/blank values and different 'null' values.
![image](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/CaseStudy2_PizzaRunner/assets/125134025/b32fe23b-363a-4a4c-a41f-85f3b8684fce)
Just like from the previous table, we need to clean up the `runner_orders` table. Once tidied, it will be more manageable for subsequent analyses and tasks. 
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT
    order_id
  , runner_id
  , CASE
      WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      ELSE pickup_time::TIMESTAMP
      END AS pickup_time
  , CASE 
      WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      ELSE TRIM(REPLACE(distance, 'km', ''))::FLOAT
      END AS distance
  , CASE
      WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'mins',''))::INT
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minute',''))::INT
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minutes',''))::INT
      ELSE duration::INT
      END AS duration
  , CASE
      WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' OR cancellation LIKE '' THEN NULL
      ELSE cancellation
      END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

SELECT *
FROM runner_orders_temp;
```
This SQL statement is creating a cleaned-up version of the `runner_orders` table. It's making sure:
-  If the `pickup_time` column has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. Otherwise, it's converted to a TIMESTAMP data type.
-  If the `distance` column has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. If it has a 'km' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to a FLOAT data type.
- The `duration` column undergoes multiple transformations:
  - If the value is 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value.
  - If the value has a 'mins' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to an INT data type.
  - If the value has a 'minute' or 'minutes' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to an INT data type.
  - Otherwise, it's directly converted to an INT data type.
- If the cancellation column is NULL, an empty string, or has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. Otherwise, the original value is retained.

### Part D: Pricing and Ratings
> 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE
        WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
        WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 10

> 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras? + Add cheese is $1 extra
```sql

> 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_runner.ratings;
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.ratings (
    rating_id   SERIAL  PRIMARY KEY -- Unique identifier for each rating
  , order_id    INT4    -- The order that the rating is associated with
  , rating      INT4    NOT NULL CHECK(rating>=1 AND rating<=5) -- The rating, which must be between 1 and 5
  , comments    TEXT  -- Any additional comments that the customer left about their experience
);
  
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.ratings (order_id, rating, comments)
SELECT 
    order_id
  , CASE 
      WHEN order_id = 1 THEN 5
      WHEN order_id = 2 THEN 4
      WHEN order_id = 3 THEN 5
      WHEN order_id = 4 THEN 3
      WHEN order_id = 5 THEN 4
      WHEN order_id = 6 THEN 5
      WHEN order_id = 7 THEN 2
      WHEN order_id = 8 THEN 4
      WHEN order_id = 9 THEN 3
      WHEN order_id = 10 THEN 5
    END AS rating
  , CASE 
      WHEN order_id = 1 THEN 'Great service! The pizza was delicious and the delivery was fast.'
      WHEN order_id = 2 THEN 'Good pizza, but the delivery took a bit longer than expected.'
      WHEN order_id = 3 THEN NULL
      WHEN order_id = 4 THEN 'Excellent service! The pizza was hot and the delivery was on time.'
      WHEN order_id = 5 THEN 'Good service overall. The pizza was tasty and the delivery was quick.'
      WHEN order_id = 6 THEN NULL
      WHEN order_id = 7 THEN 'The pizza was not as good as usual, and the delivery was late.'
      WHEN order_id = 8 THEN NULL
      WHEN order_id = 9 THEN NULL
      WHEN order_id = 10 THEN 'Excellent! The pizza was delicious and the delivery was fast.'
    END AS comments
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL;

SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.ratings ORDER BY order_id;
```

> 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries? + customer_id + order_id + runner_id + rating + order_time + pickup_time + Time between order and pickup + Delivery duration + Average speed + Total number of pizzas
```sql
SELECT
    t1.customer_id
  , t1.order_id
  , t2.runner_id
  , t3.rating
  , t1.order_time
  , t2.pickup_time
  , EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (t2.pickup_time - t1.order_time)) AS pickup_minutes
  , t2.duration
  , ROUND(t2.distance::NUMERIC / (t2.duration::NUMERIC / 60), 1) AS avg_speed
  , COUNT(t1.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders_temp AS t1

> 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
```sql
WITH cost_per_order AS (
  SELECT
      t1.order_id
    , SUM(CASE 
        WHEN t2.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
        WHEN t2.pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
        END) AS pizza_cost
    , t1.distance * 0.3 AS delivery_cost
  FROM runner_orders_temp AS t1 
  INNER JOIN customer_orders_temp AS t2 
    ON t1.order_id = t2.order_id
  WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY 
      t1.order_id
    , t1.distance
)
SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(pizza_cost - delivery_cost)::NUMERIC, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM cost_per_order;

### Part E: Bonus Question
> If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_names_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE pizza_names_temp AS
  SELECT * 
  FROM pizza_runner.pizza_names;

INSERT INTO pizza_names_temp (pizza_id, pizza_name)
VALUES
  (3, 'Supreme');

SELECT * FROM pizza_names_temp;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_recipes_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE pizza_recipes_temp AS
  SELECT * 
  FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes;

INSERT INTO pizza_recipes_temp (pizza_id, toppings)
SELECT
  3,
  STRING_AGG(topping_id::TEXT, ', ')
FROM pizza_runner.pizza_toppings;

SELECT * FROM pizza_recipes_temp;
```
