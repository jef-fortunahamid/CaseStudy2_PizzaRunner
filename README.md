## Genaral Insights
- *Customer and Runner Experience:* The queries delved into understanding the efficiency and experience of runners. This included insights into the number of runners signing up each week, the average time taken for order pickups, and the relationship between the number of pizzas ordered and preparation time.
- *Ingredient Optimization:* Several questions aimed to understand the standard ingredients for each pizza, the most commonly added extras, and the most common exclusions. This provides insights into customer preferences and potential areas for menu optimization.
- *Pricing and Ratings:* This section focused on understanding the revenue generated by Pizza Runner. It considered fixed pizza prices, additional charges for extras, and delivery fees. Additionally, a new ratings system was proposed to capture customer feedback on their delivery experience.
- *Menu Expansion:* The bonus question explored the implications of adding a new pizza type to the menu, demonstrating how the current data design can accommodate such changes.

## Key SQL Syntax and Functions
- Temporary Tables (CREATE TEMP TABLE)
- Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT SEMI JOIN)
- Aggregation Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- Window Functions(RANK)
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)
- Date Functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATE_PART, AGE)
- String Functions (STRING_AGG, REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE)

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
### Table: customer_orders
If we are going to look closely at the table, there are some inconsistencies.
- There are missing/blanks and null values in both `exclusions` and `extras` columns
![image](https://github.com/jef-fortunahamid/CaseStudy2_PizzaRunner/assets/125134025/95ce827d-cf61-4041-b1fc-f2ac11e0e030)
We must clean up the `customer_orders` table. This cleaned-up table will be easier to work with for subsequent analyses and operations. We will proceed with the following:
- We need to create a temporary table with cleaned `exlcusions` and `extras` columns.
- We will replace the missing/blanks and 'null' values with NULL value.
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS 
SELECT
    order_id
  , customer_id
  , pizza_id
  , CASE 
      WHEN exclusions IN ('', 'null') THEN NULL
      ELSE exclusions
      END AS exclusions
  , CASE 
      WHEN extras IN ('', 'null') THEN NULL
      ELSE extras
      END AS extras
  , order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

SELECT *
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
In this query, the `CASE WHEN` statement checks if the `exclusions` and `extras` values are blank ('') and 'null', and if so, replaces them with the `NULL` value.

### Table: runner_orders
Again, if we are going to look closely at this table, there are some issues.
- In the `pickup_time` column, we don't know if the null values correspond to the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `distance` column, there are a few issues here. We have values where the number is directly followed by 'km' without a space. We also have instances where there's a space between the number and 'km'. Additionally, it's unclear if the null values are the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `duration` column, quite a few issues here as well. We've got mins, minute and minutes, both with and without spaces. Additionally, it's uncertain whether the null values correspond to the desired 'NULL' values.
- In the `cancellation` column, we've got missing/blank values and different 'null' values.

Just like from the previous table, we need to clean up the `runner_orders` table. Once tidied, it will be more manageable for subsequent analyses and tasks. 
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT
    order_id
  , runner_id
  , CASE
      WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      ELSE pickup_time::TIMESTAMP
      END AS pickup_time
  , CASE 
      WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      ELSE TRIM(REPLACE(distance, 'km', ''))::FLOAT
      END AS distance
  , CASE
      WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN NULL
      WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'mins',''))::INT
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minute',''))::INT
      WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minutes',''))::INT
      ELSE duration::INT
      END AS duration
  , CASE
      WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' OR cancellation LIKE '' THEN NULL
      ELSE cancellation
      END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

SELECT *
FROM runner_orders_temp;
```
This SQL statement is creating a cleaned-up version of the `runner_orders` table. It's making sure:
-  If the `pickup_time` column has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. Otherwise, it's converted to a TIMESTAMP data type.
-  If the `distance` column has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. If it has a 'km' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to a FLOAT data type.
- The `duration` column undergoes multiple transformations:
  - If the value is 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value.
  - If the value has a 'mins' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to an INT data type.
  - If the value has a 'minute' or 'minutes' suffix, that suffix is removed, and the remaining value is converted to an INT data type.
  - Otherwise, it's directly converted to an INT data type.
- If the cancellation column is NULL, an empty string, or has a value of 'null' (as a string), it's converted to an actual NULL value. Otherwise, the original value is retained.
